A text-based SVG editor for the web.

# Instructions

- Disk icon - *Download* the svg file
- Box + arrow - *Export* the svg file as a png (this is done with a custom canvas renderer such that it will not run into security issues)
- Eye - *Preview* as a png.  Canvas renderer is highly experimental, incomplete and may not produce what you expect.
- Line - Adds a sample ```line```.
- Box - Add a sample ```rect```.
- Circle - Add a sample ```circle```.
- Oval - Add a sample ```ellipse```.
- Triangle - Add a sample ```polygon```.
- Squiggle - Add a sample ```path```.
- T - Add a sample ```text```.
- Curly Brackets - *Pretty print* the current code
- Checker box - Sets the *background*.
- Settings - Unused
- Wire box - Save to *dropbox*

All work is saved automatically in local storage so as long as you don't empty cache you should be okay.

Use the tabs at the bottom to switch between CSS and SVG.

If you haven't visited in a while it's advised that you clear all service worker caches just in case.
